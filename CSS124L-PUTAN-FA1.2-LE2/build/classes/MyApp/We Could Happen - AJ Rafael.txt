I'll hold the door, please, come in
And just sit here for a while
This is my way of telling you I need you in my life
It's so cold without your touch
I've been dreaming way too much
Can we just turn this into reality?

'Cause I've been thinking 'bout you lately
Maybe you could save me from this crazy world we live in
And I know we could happen
'Cause you know that I've been feeling you

Storms, they will come
But I know that the sun will shine again
He's my friend, and he says that we belong together
And I'll sing a song to break the ice
Just a smile from you would suffice
It's not me being nice, but this is real tonight

'Cause I've been thinking 'bout you lately
Maybe you could save me from this crazy world we live in
And I know we could happen
'Cause you know that I've been feeling you
I know you want me

There's no other, there's no other love
That I'd rather have, you know
There ain't no one, there ain't no one else
I want you for myself

I've been thinking 'bout you lately
Maybe you could save me from this crazy world we live in
And I know we could happen
'Cause you know that I've been feeling you
I know you want me

I've been thinking 'bout you lately
Maybe you could save me from this crazy world we live in
And I know we could happen
'Cause you know that I've been feeling you
I know you want me too

I know you want me too
Ah-oh-oh-oh-oh
Pa-pa-ra, pa-pa-ra
